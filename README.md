# Motion Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles
## The final project for Udacity's Planning and Decision making

### Here are some details about the project:

The Behavior Planner is responsible for high-level decisions about the vehicle's motion, such as which lane to drive in and whether to change lanes. It uses a variety of sensors, including a camera, radar, and lidar, to perceive the environment and make these decisions.
The Motion Planner is responsible for low-level control of the vehicle's motion, such as steering, throttle, and brake. It uses the Behavior Planner's decisions to generate a smooth and safe trajectory for the vehicle to follow.
The two planners work together to allow the vehicle to safely navigate its environment. The Behavior Planner makes high-level decisions about the vehicle's motion, and the Motion Planner then generates a low-level trajectory that follows those decisions. This allows the vehicle to react to changes in its environment in a safe and timely manner.

The project also includes a number of additional features, such as the ability to:

* Detect and track other vehicles on the road.
* Generate a path that avoids obstacles.
* Follow a lane line.
* Stop at intersections.
* These features allow the vehicle to safely navigate a variety of different environments, such as city streets, highways, and parking lots.

The project is a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in self-driving cars. It provides an introduction to the two main components of a traditional hierarchical planner, and it gives students (me personally) the opportunity to implement these components in a real-world application.
